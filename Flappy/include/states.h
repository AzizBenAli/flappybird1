/**
 * @file states.h
 * @author Alex Hoffman
 * @copyright GNU GPL v3
 * @brief A basic state machine implementation
 *
 * This basic state machine implementation shows the basic concept of a state
 * machine where each state is represented by a data object that contains
 * function points to an init, enter, run and exit function.
 *
 * Basic use of this framework requires the user to firstly add the states using
 *
 * @code
 * states_add(init, enter, run, exit, ID, name)
 * @endcode
 *
 * Once the states have been added an optional callback can be set for the
 * state machine. It runs after the execution of each state machine cycle. This
 * is set using
 *
 * @code
 * states_set_callback(*function)
 * @endcode
 *
 * The states can then be initialized such that their probe functions are
 * called. This is done using
 *
 * @code
 * states_init()
 * #endcode
 *
 * The initial state can be set using
 *
 * @code
 * states_set_state(state_ID)
 * @endcode
 *
 * Otherwise the first state added is run by default. This call is the same that
 * is used to change state during the machines execution.
