/**
 * @defgroup aio_comms Async IO API
 *
 * @brief Asynchronous Linux Based Communications API allows for the creation
 * of asynchronous communications channels that allow for passive IO through
 * the use of callbacks
 *
 * Focusing on sockets (UDP and TCP) and POSIX message queues, this API allows
 * for the creation of the particular IO stream, registering a callback to the
 * stream that is automatically called when a communication event is triggered
 * on the stream. For example a UDP packet is send to the port that is bound
 * to the socket associated to the IO stream, passing the received packet buffer
 * to the user-defined callback.
